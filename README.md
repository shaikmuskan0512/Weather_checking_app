# Weather Checking App

A web application that lets users check the current temperature and humidity for any city or location worldwide by fetching real-time data from a weather API.

## Features

- Search weather data by city or place name
- Displays current temperature and humidity
- Responsive and easy-to-use interface
- Uses a public weather API for accurate real-time data

## How It Works

The app sends a request to a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) with the userâ€™s input city name. The API responds with weather data, which the app then displays, focusing on temperature and humidity.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaikmuskan0512/Weather_checking_app.git
Usage

Enter the city name in the search box.

Click the search button.

View the temperature and humidity data displayed instantly.
